# Project Scaffold

This scaffold provides a ready-to-copy project documentation structure for the AI Task Framework v2.

## How to Use

### Option A: New Project

1. Copy the entire `scaffold/` contents into your project root
2. Follow [`.ai-framework/guides/getting-started.md`](.ai-framework/guides/getting-started.md) — start with the **New Project** path
3. Fill templates in order: Persona → Stakeholder → CLAUDE.md → Architecture → Data Model → API Spec → UI Spec

### Option B: Existing Codebase

1. Copy the entire `scaffold/` contents into your project root
2. Follow [`.ai-framework/guides/getting-started.md`](.ai-framework/guides/getting-started.md) — start with the **Existing Codebase** path
3. Fill templates in order: CLAUDE.md → Stakeholder → Architecture → Data Model → API Spec → UI Spec → Persona

## Scaffold vs Full Templates

| | Scaffold (this) | Full Templates (`.ai-framework/templates/`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Quick start — fill in the essentials | Reference — comprehensive coverage |
| **Time to fill** | 15-30 min per file | 1-2 hours per file |
| **Detail level** | Section headers + fill prompts | Full guidance, examples, edge cases |
| **When to use** | Starting a project | Deepening documentation later |

## Tips

- **Don't overthink it.** A rough first pass beats a perfect blank page. You can always refine later.
- **Use the full templates as reference.** If a scaffold section feels unclear, check the corresponding file in `.ai-framework/templates/` for detailed guidance.
- **CLAUDE.md is the most frequently used.** Even a minimal version helps AI generate better code immediately.
- **Generate specs from docs.** After filling Stakeholder + Architecture + CLAUDE.md, use `.ai-framework/prompts/spec-generation.md` to auto-generate Data Model and API Spec, then `.ai-framework/prompts/ui-spec-generation.md` for the UI Spec.
- **Update as you go.** These are living documents. Revisit them as your project evolves (see [`.ai-framework/guides/maintenance.md`](.ai-framework/guides/maintenance.md)).
- **Upgrading the framework.** Check `.ai-framework/VERSION` to see which version you have. To upgrade, replace the `.ai-framework/` folder with the latest version from the framework repo — your project docs are unaffected.
